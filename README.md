Note that in actuality, this repository contains a lot more JavaScript code than meets the eye. However, because I haven't made separate JavaScript files to be referenced in my frontend files, but rather put all the relevant javaScript code in <script></script> entries in the HTML code, GitHub detects the repository as being primarily comprised of HTML lines.
